# Mars-News
For this segment of the challenge, I used automated browsing with Splinter to visit the Mars news site and used Beautiful Soup to extract the HTML code. I then scraped and extracted preview text of the news articles as well as their titles. The scraped data wqas then stored in a list of dictionaries using python.

# Mars-Weather
For this second segment I used Splinter and Beautiful Soup to scrape the data from the table and create a pandas dataframe using the scraped data. I then used this dataframe to analyze the data found on the website to answer and plot multiple different questions. After using the information, I exported the dataframe into a CSV file (mars_data.csv).
